# Librarian Helper

This web app was made during my 2nd semester of undergraduate studies as a side project to help the college library run more efficiently.
The project was made using Eclipse EE IDE.

## Requirements:
- Java Development Kit (jdk 10.0.2)
- Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers 2017
- Apache Tomcat 9.0
- Apache/2.4.33
- MySQL 5.7.21

## Running the web app

Install the above requirements. Create a database in phpMyAdmin with the name `library` and them import the `library.sql` file and execute the queries.

Import the project files into the Eclipse IDE and update your respective database username and password as what you have set. Also, update the port numbers that are on your system.

Set the run configuration to run on Apache Tomcat server. You are good to go.
